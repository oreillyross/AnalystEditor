    <div>
      <h1>This is the logged in page</h1>
      <p>
        The idea here is to show the logged in users favourite scenarios (come
        up with better word for this) and to graphically display by default one
        week predictions, then the use can change this to one omnth, one year,
        or even the other way to one day. It is a kindof dashboard where the
        user can easily see a list of all thier scenarios, by lcikcing on each
        one the user is taken to another view where they can see the scenario
        with the linked indicators, tags, etc. but also they can see how it has
        changed over time.
      </p>
    </div>
